		<h2 id="title">FOUNDATION MISSION</h2>

		<h4>
		The Cleveland National Forest Foundation is a nonprofit group dedicated 
		to preserving the plants, animals and other natural resources of Southern 
		California mountains by protecting the land and water they need to survive. 
		</h4>

		<p>
		Few areas in North America display the concentration of plants and animals
		as diverse as those found in Cleveland National Forest. The chaparral,
		meadows and pine-oak woodlands that grace the mountains and foothills
		are especially rich in unique species.</p><p> President Theodore Roosevelt and
		Congress established Cleveland National Forest in 1906 to protect this
		mountainous area of Southern California. Since that time, civilization
		rose around all sides of this wilderness province, and the original
		national forest boundaries enclosing two million acres diminished to
		a modern-day area of 650,000.</p><p> One by one, unique wildlife and plants
		disappeared, including the California condor, grizzly bear, black bear,
		long-eared kit fox and pronghorn antelope. Today, many of the remaining
		plants and animals of Cleveland National Forest are threatened by urban
		development: puma, mule deer, golden eagle, bald eagle, California spotted
		owl, pond turtle, San Diego thornmint and many more mammals, reptiles,
		butterflies and plants. Large areas of open land are critical for their
		survival. The forest provides valuable watershed and grazing areas and
		on its mountains are found two world-class observatories.</p><h4> Excessive
		development in this remarkable ecosystem would bring about the demise
		of foothill and mountain life as we know it. Like the organs of a body,
		the chaparral, wood-lands, meadows and streams are vital to the health
		of a forest. Therefore, we must vigilantly protect, defend and secure
		our wilderness for the well-being of all Southern Californians. 
		</h4><h4>The Cleveland National Forest Foundation is committed to sustainable 
		regional land use planning in order to stem the tide of urban encroachment 
		of our wild-lands.
